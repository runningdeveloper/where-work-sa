# Where Work SA

Website: [https://runningdeveloper.github.io/where-work-sa/](https://runningdeveloper.github.io/where-work-sa/)

## What

A random experiment to make it easy for a developer somewhere in South Africa to make a open-source contribution. Add a work place or adjust the website. Go to the [contibution guide](https://github.com/runningdeveloper/where-work-sa/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to add your contibution. 

This might be a dumb thing but sometimes you got to try things.

## Why

I want an easy way for people to contribute to an opensource project for stuff like [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com). I have no idea what I'm doing so please leave an issue for ideas.

## Run locally
